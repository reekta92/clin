# clin
A very simple CLI notes program programmed in C# and .NET SDK 9.0, needs to be added to the "Path" variable to make it usable from terminal.

Adding program to the path on Windows:

**This PC(right-click) -> Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables -> Path(In System Variables) -> Edit -> Browse the installation directory of clin and add it -> Save the changes**

Now you should be able to run clin from your terminal with "clin" command.
